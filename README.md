# Ubuntu-LTS

A collection of opinionated Ansible roles to be used for managing Ubuntu LTS (Trusty) Workstations.

These are intended to be used with [Pajuna](https://github.com/pajuna/mystation) but are really just normal Ansible roles.

## Requirement

A lot of these roles rely on you to have an `$HOME/.dotfiles` directory with all your existing dotfiles.
